   This is little Qt (but it is console program) tool for creating data files
   in format recognized by the module. It also makes it possible to control
   the device directly (if the module is loaded).

   It takes name of the graphic file (in one of the formats supported by
   Qt 3.3 library) and either produces text file, that can be written
   to /sys interface of the module (if output file is given with -o parameter),
   or it send the data directly to the /sys interface, if no output file
   is given.

   It is drop-in replacement for 'asusoled' - it accepts the same commands
   and much more:
   - Static, Rolling and Flashing pictures are supported.
   - Aditional 'Flashing/Rolling' mode is possible - in this mode, upper
      half of the picture will be flashing, and lower will be rolled.
   - Graphic files don't need to be correct size, they will be resized,
     either automatically, or to the given size. It will try to preserve
     the ratio of the picture if it is possible.
   - It is possible to specify both enable/disable and send a picture
     with one command.
   - Some basic image processing options:
     * Inversion of pixel values black <-> white
     * 'BlackBackground' method - when there is a lot of white color
       around the main element of the picture, but black elements should
       stay black (for example tux logo), this method changes all white
       pixels in the background to black, leaving only 1 pixel from sides
       of the element.


*******

   To compile the program, just run:
   qmake && make in the tool/ directory

   You need to have qt-3.3 library, although the program works in console mode.
